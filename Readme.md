# Birthday candle Problem
## Problem Statement
In this problem an array with n length is given and we need to find the maximum value in the array, also we need to find the count of the maximum element of the array.
## Solution
I have used the following approach to solve the problem.
- First I have found the maximum number in the array of candle by looping over the array.
```python3
for i in candles:
        if i>maxheightcandles
```
- By the above loop and condition I got the maximum number from the array.
- The next step is we have to get the count of the maximum number from the array.
```python3
 for i in range(len(candles)):
        if candles[i]==maxheightcandles:
```
- From the above code lines I will get the count of the maximum number in the array
- With this I am able to get the maximum heighted candle and the number of the maximum heighted candles in the given array.
